# 🎓 Blockchain-based Honor Society

Welcome to a decentralized honor society built on the Stacks blockchain! This project addresses the real-world problem of centralized control in traditional honor societies, where membership decisions, resource access, and governance are often opaque, exclusive, and prone to bias. By leveraging NFTs for memberships, on-chain voting, and smart contracts, we create a transparent, merit-based system that empowers communities to induct members democratically, grant access to exclusive resources (like educational materials, events, or funding), and ensure immutable records of achievements.

## ✨ Features

🏅 NFT-based memberships representing honor society induction
🗳️ On-chain voting for proposing and approving new inductees
🔑 Gated access to exclusive resources (e.g., digital libraries, webinars, or grants)
📊 Reputation system to track member contributions
💰 Treasury management for society funds and donations
📜 Immutable logging of all society events and decisions
🤝 Multi-sig governance for key decisions
🚫 Revocation mechanisms for inactive or violating members

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Prospective Members**
- Submit an application with proof of achievements (e.g., a hash of credentials or links)
- Existing members propose your induction via the ProposalContract
- Society votes using the VotingContract – achieve quorum to mint your MembershipNFT

**For Existing Members**
- Use your MembershipNFT to access resources via the AccessControlContract
- Participate in voting on new inductees or governance proposals
- Earn reputation points through contributions, tracked in the ReputationContract
- Donate to or withdraw from the society treasury managed by the TreasuryContract

**For Verifiers and Admins**
- Query the EventLoggerContract for transparent audit trails
- Use the GovernanceContract for multi-sig approvals on major changes
- Revoke memberships if needed via the RevocationContract (requires supermajority vote)

That's it! A fully decentralized honor society where merit and community drive decisions.

## 📂 Smart Contracts

This project is built using Clarity on the Stacks blockchain and involves 8 smart contracts for modularity and security:

1. **MembershipNFT.clar**: Handles minting, transferring, and querying NFT-based memberships. Uses STX-721 standard for NFTs.
2. **ProposalContract.clar**: Allows members to submit induction proposals for new candidates, including metadata like achievements.
3. **VotingContract.clar**: Manages on-chain voting mechanics, including quorum checks, vote tallying, and time-bound polls.
4. **AccessControlContract.clar**: Enforces gated access to resources; verifies NFT ownership before granting permissions (e.g., to IPFS-hosted content).
5. **ReputationContract.clar**: Tracks member reputation scores based on contributions, votes, or events; influences voting weights.
6. **TreasuryContract.clar**: Manages society funds, including deposits, withdrawals, and allocations (e.g., for grants) with multi-sig requirements.
7. **GovernanceContract.clar**: Oversees high-level society rules, like changing quorum thresholds or updating contract parameters via proposals.
8. **EventLoggerContract.clar**: Logs all key events (e.g., inductions, votes, revocations) immutably for transparency and auditing.
9. **RevocationContract.clar**: Handles membership revocations based on votes, ensuring due process and recording reasons on-chain.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install the Stacks CLI and Clarity tools.
2. Deploy the contracts in order (starting with MembershipNFT as it’s foundational).
3. Interact via the Stacks explorer or custom frontend.
4. Test on the Stacks testnet before mainnet deployment.
